This repo is part of the ML-101 and ML-201 course material from me. The other mentors' materials are not collected. 

The files include:

### Dataframes

- [pandas quiz answer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/pandas_quiz_answer.html): basic pandas dataframe, including basic pyspark.

- [basic pyspark](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/spark.html): getting to know some spark.

- [working with text](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/working_with_text.html): basic regular expression and text mining methods such as tokenize. This is preparation for text mining and NLP classes afterwards.

- [pandas apply function special session](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/pandas_apply.html): to answer some questions regarding the use of apply function.


### Machine learning algorithms

- [classification basics](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/classificationBasic.html): common scikit clasfication models and measurements.

- [preprocessing basics](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/preprocessing-session9.html): outlier detection, imbalanced data, scalers, missing data, dimensional reduction, feature selection, etc. There's an extra part added for bias in AI at the end.

- [classification and preprocessing homework answers](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/session9_answer_hw.html): including the use of pipelines at the end.

- [regression basics](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/regressionBasic.html): common scikit learn regression models and measurements, cross-validation.

- [questions and answers](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/QandA.html) from the previous classes: understanding of regression and classification from the perspective of maximum likelihood estimation.

- [timeseries forecast basics](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/timeseriesBasic.html) as a special type of regression: decomposition, moving average, double and tripple smoothing, ARIMA.

### Neural networks

- [intro to neural network](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/NN-intro.html): build a simple neural network from raw python, test its forward and backward passes. Exercises at the end to change input dimension, select another activation function and rewrite the backpropagation.

- [RNN basics](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/lstm_basic.html): homework for the next class, getting to know recurrent neural networks, LSTM, autoencoder and attention. 

- [pytorch and RNN for timeseries I](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/lstm_pytorch.html): introduction to pytorch, use its off-the-shelf LSTM layer for the same timeseries forecast exercise.

- [RNN for timeseries II](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/lstm_pytorch2.html): build a more complete model with multiple layers in pytorch, and test it with the timeseries exercise.


### Final project example

- [LA covid cases: timeseries forecast](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natnij/ML_coaching_material/blob/main/material/101_LAvaccine_project_example.html): an example project from beginning to end, including the cleaning of a (very) messy data source, some data exploration, and a simple learning model. You can use it as a reference for your own end-of-the-term project.
